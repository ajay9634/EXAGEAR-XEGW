Yes, But It's in very early stage and may not work at all.

‚ö°‚ö°‚ö°ED 5.1, DRI 3, XEGW 2

- based on multiwine 7.4 dri3 
- added my direct x and some other files
- deleted some Extra files
- reduced cache size
- replace prefix to Ajay prefix

Note- fps may be different in the non dri3  environment, everything is changed.
Some games have better fps in Turnip DXVK, and some games have better fps in the dri3 environment.
Don't use dri3 in dxvk 2.0 below like 1.10.3 and dxvk 0.96, fps maybe low.
